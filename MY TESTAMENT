When I die, let me be buried

In my beloved Ukraine,

My tomb upon a grave-mound high,

Amid the wide-spread plain,

That the fields, the steppe unbounded,

The Dnieper�s plunging shore

My eye could see, my ear could hear

The mighty river roar,

When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears

Into the deep blue sea

The blood of foes� then will I leave

These hills and fertile fields �

I�ll leave them all behind and fly

To the abode of God

To sing His praise� But till that day �

I nothing know of God.

On bury me, then rise ye up

And break your heavy chains

And water with the tyrants� blood

The freedom you have gained.

And in the great new family,

The family of the free,

With softly-spoken kindly word

Remember also me.
