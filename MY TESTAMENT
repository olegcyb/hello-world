When I die, let me be buried

In my beloved Ukraine,

My tomb upon a grave-mound high,

Amid the wide-spread plain,

That the fields, the steppe unbounded,

The Dniepers plunging shore

My eye could see, my ear could hear

The mighty river roar,

When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears

Into the deep blue sea

The blood of foes then will I leave

These hills and fertile fields 

Ill leave them all behind and fly

To the abode of God

To sing His praise But till that day 

I nothing know of God.

On bury me, then rise ye up

And break your heavy chains

And water with the tyrants blood

The freedom you have gained.

And in the great new family,

The family of the free,

With softly-spoken kindly word

Remember also me.
